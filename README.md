Weather App

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A weather app detects and provides concise weather information for different locations.

It includes features like entering a location, fetching weather data from an API, and displaying the temperature, condition, and location on the screen. It also uses the device's GPS to fetch the current location.

While making a weather app in Flutter, the code combines Flutter's UI components, HTTP requests, and location services to create a weather app that fetches and displays weather information based on the entered location or the device's current location.

We use following packages:

dart:convert: Used for encoding and decoding JSON data.

package: flutter/material.dart: Provides the Flutter framework and UI components.

package:http/http.dart: Enables making HTTP requests to fetch weather data from an API.

package:geolocator/geolocator.dart: Allows retrieving the device's current location using GPS.
